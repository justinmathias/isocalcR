The goal of `isocalcR` is to provide a suite of user-friendly, open source functions for commonly performed calculations when working with stable isotope data. A major goal of `isocalcR` is to help eliminate errors associated with data compilation necessary for many standard calculations, as well as to provide the scientific community with a reliable, easily accessible resource for reproducible work. Part of this effort includes best practices of data usage, as the user is not required to download atmospheric CO~2~ or atmospheric δ^13^CO~2~ data for the workhorse calculations, but instead relies on published, peer-reviewed, and recommended publicly available data (Belmecheri and Lavergne, 2020). `isocalcR` is not meant to replace an understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms related to these calculations, but instead to streamline the process. At present, calculations for years 0 C.E. - 2019 C.E. will work, with 2020 available for the development version. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of isocalcR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("isocalcR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("justinmathias/isocalcR")
```

## Examples

Calculate leaf intrinsic water use efficiency from leaf δ^13^C:

```{r example}
library(isocalcR) #Load the package
d13C.to.iWUE(-27, 2015, 300, 25) #Calculate iWUE from leaf organic material with a δ13C signature of -27 ‰ for the year 2015, 300 meters above sea level at 25°C.
```

Data for atmospheric CO~2~ and atmospheric δ^13^CO~2~ for the period 0 C.E. to 2019 C.E. can be loaded and viewed.  Data are from Belmecheri and Lavergne (2020).

```{r CO2data}
